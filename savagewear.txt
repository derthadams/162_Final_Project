Savage-Wear$
You step into an elegant space with parquet floors and chandeliers, with racks
of clothes along the walls. All around is the glint of latex and leather.$
As you enter, Hans looks up, bored, and says, "Oh, you again?"$
Hans$
Hans, a tall man wearing a latex kilt, long overcoat
and black latex policeman's hat stands at the counter reading a magazine.
Without looking up he gestures to the clothes and says, "Have a look around."$
Ja.$
Good.$
That does not look so bad!$
Never.$
Are you kidding?$
Perhaps fashion is not your thing.$
Va- va- voom!$
Git it, gurl!$
They're going to go crazy for that at the club!$
Hmm... that's not working.$
I'm not sure if that's doing what you want it to.$
I'm afraid that's not your best look.$
