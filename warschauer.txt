Warschauer Strasse$
You see two storefronts:

Savage-Wear
A sly cartoon cat winks at you from the sign. In the window you
see mannequins that look kind of like blow-up dolls.
One is wearing a military-themed latex ensemble and the other has on a
form-fitting latex dress with broad horizontal black and white stripes.

Darkstore
A small boutique whose name is scrawled in blood-red gothic script
all over the brick wall. A sign on the door says “Domain du Nacht!”
In the display window you catch a glimpse of a white satin lace-up bustier.

You could try your luck at one of these neighborhood stores, or you could go
shopping in Kreuzberg, another neighborhood a mile away.

You consult your phone.

Walking to Kreuzberg will take 20 minutes.
Taking a car to Kreuzberg will only take 5 minutes but costs €10.

You could go back to Berghain, but are you ready?$
