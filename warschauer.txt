Warschauer Strasse$
You see two storefronts:

Savage-Wear
A sly cartoon cat winks at you from the sign. In the window you
see mannequins that look kind of like blow-up dolls.
One is wearing a military-themed latex ensemble and the other has on a
form-fitting latex dress with broad horizontal black and white stripes.

Darkstore
A small boutique whose name is scrawled in blood-red gothic script
all over the brick wall. A sign on the door says “Domain du Nacht!”
In the display window you catch a glimpse of a white satin lace-up bustier.

You could try your luck at one of these neighborhood stores, or you could go
shopping in Kreuzberg, another neighborhood a mile away.

You consult your phone.

Walking to Kreuzberg will take 20 minutes.
Taking a car to Kreuzberg will only take 5 minutes but costs €10.

You could go back to Berghain, but are you ready?$
With all of the shops on the street closed, the only source of light is
the massive, pulsing spectacle of Berghain.

Sven is waiting across the street.

Walking to Kreuzberg takes 20 minutes, but what's the point?
Taking a car to Kreuzberg would now be a waste of €10.$
