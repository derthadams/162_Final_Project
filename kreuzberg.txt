Kreuzberg Strasse$
The street is alive with hipsters wandering in packs between the restaurants,
bars and clubs. You notice two clothing stores on the block:

Slacks Fashion
Above the red wood-paneled facade hangs a sign with the name of the store in
elegant script. In the window display you see a knee-length dress with
lace-edged panels and some top hats.

Pink Cadillac
Behind the baby-blue facade you see a busy display with bright neon-colored
clothes bathed in blacklight.

You could sample the wares at one of these shops, or you could go back to
Warschauer Strasse.

Walking to Warschauer takes 20 minutes.
Taking a car to Warschauer takes 5 minutes but costs €10.$
