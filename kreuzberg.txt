Kreuzberg Strasse$
The street is alive with hipsters wandering in packs between the restaurants,
bars and clubs. You notice two clothing stores on the block:

                               ║  Slacks Fashion  ║

Above the red wood-paneled facade hangs a sign with the name of the store in
elegant script. In the window display you see a knee-length dress with
lace-edged panels and some top hats.

                                ║  Pink Cadillac  ║

Behind the baby-blue facade you see a busy display with bright neon-colored
clothes bathed in blacklight.

You could sample the wares at one of these shops, or you could go back to
Warschauer Strasse.

Walking to Warschauer takes 20 minutes.
Taking a car to Warschauer takes 5 minutes but costs €10.$
All the storefronts on the street are dark. You race from one to the other,
but nothing is open.

With all of your options exhausted, you might as well go back to
Warschauer Strasse and see how Sven feels about your outfit now.
