Slacks Fashion$
You enter a room with crown molding and distressed antique wallpaper. An old
gramophone plays in the corner. Ute, the saleslady, walks over, her heels
clacking on the hardwood floor.$
Ute greets you with a "So happy to see you again."$
Ute$
She's wearing a mustard corset with black lace trim that shows off her
colorful chest tattoos. Her long, bright red hair emerges from a giant
floral headdress.$
You look ravishing.$
So sophisticated!$
That looks incredible, you vixen!$
You may want to choose something else.$
I see where you're trying to go, but that does not get you there.$
That's not the best choice for you.$
That look is fire!$
Gurrrl... Yes!$
You're an icon.$
I don't know about that one.$
You look like a French maid... and not in a good way.$
Maybe not.$
